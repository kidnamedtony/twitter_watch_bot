# These are the variables you want the Twitter bot to watch out for. Feel free to replace or add
# to these terms with watch words of your own!
watch_lst = ["replace", "these", "test", "terms", "with", "something", "else"]

# NOTE: just in case you're wondering, case doesn't matter. The way that the twitter_watch_bot
# is currently designed, it sets all terms (both in the watch_lst and in the tweets it watches)
# to lower case before matching and fuzzy-matching them.
